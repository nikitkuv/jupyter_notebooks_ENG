# Selection of oil most prolific region and oil production prediction
There are oil samples from 3 regions, 10 000 samples each.

**Status:** Completed

**Goal**: Build a model to determine the region with highest revenue from oil production and analyse possible revenue and risks using *bootstraping*.

**Stack:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, math;

**Conclusions:**
- The highest mean profit is expected to be in region 2
- The most accurate estimation of profit is seen in region 2
- The lowest loss risk is in region 2 which is approximately equal to 1.12% and lower than claimed 2.5%

## Data description

- id — unique well identifier;
- f0, f1, f2 — oil parameters;
- product — oil reserves in well (thousands of barrels).
